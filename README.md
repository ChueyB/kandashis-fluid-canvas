# Fluid Canvas

This module allows you to sync canvas animations between your players. Send earthquakes as a city wall topples, a heartbeat pulse as a player draws close to death or a drunken haze as they stumble from the nearby tavern.

Access this through the FluidCanvas control on the left side bar <i class="fas fa-wind"></i>

Shift click to open the User Selection UI and use - or + to increase or decrease the intensity of the effect
